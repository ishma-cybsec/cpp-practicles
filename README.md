# C++ Practical Programs

This repository contains C++ practical programs for Computer Science from my grade 12th practical file work.  
Each program demonstrates key concepts in C++ such as arrays, loops, sorting, object-oriented programming, constructors, inheritance, and file handling.

## Programs Included

1. **binary_search.cpp** – Performs binary search on a sorted array.  
2. **bubble_sort.cpp** – Sorts an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.  
3. **array_traversal.cpp** – Traverses and prints all elements of an array.  
4. **swap_pointers.cpp** – Swaps two numbers using pointers.  
5. **reverse_string.cpp** – Reverses a string.  
6. **complex_addition.cpp** – Adds two complex numbers.  
7. **circle_constructor.cpp** – Demonstrates a default constructor in a Circle class.  
8. **fraction_equivalent.cpp** – Uses constructors to find fractional equivalent.  
9. **ratio_class.cpp** – Shows constructor and destructor using Ratio class.  
10. **inheritance.cpp** – Demonstrates class inheritance.  
11. **file_operations.cpp** – Demonstrates basic file read/write operations.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the `.cpp` file.
3. Compile the program:
```bash
g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
